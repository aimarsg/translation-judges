On the other hand, Translation B uses the more common and idiomatic expression \"ingurukoen zerbitzura jarri\" is not used in this context, but \"ingurukoen zerbitzura\" is, which is not the best fit. However, the use of \"zerbitzura\" instead of \"zerbitzura jarri\" makes the sentence sound more fluent and natural. Translation A also uses the word \"etxerik gabekoentzat\" which is a more common way to express \"for the homeless\", but it's not as idiomatic as \"etxerik gabeko pertsonentzako\" in Translation B. However, Translation A uses the word \"prestatuz\" which is not the most common way to express \"by preparing\", but it's more idiomatic in this context than \"prestatuz, besteak beste\" in Translation B.
